  provider.
* Add 'autoverify' provider policy to automatically verify the user's
  email. Obsolete the 'SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION' setting.

  a resource is shared to the members of the project that the resource belongs
  to.
  * Extend `reassign` API call with the 'shared_to_project' field that can be
  used to share or unshare a resource to project members.

.. _Changelog-0.16:

v0.16
=====

Released: Tue Nov 11 10:44:57 EET 2014

Synnefo-wide
------------

* Replace accumulative projects with pool projects:

  * Projects are now viewed as a source of finite resources. A member can
    reserve a part of these resources up to a specified limit.

  * Base quota are now offered through a special purpose user-specific system
    project, identified with the same UUID as the user.

  * Each actual resource (Cyclades VM, network, floating IP and Pithos
    container) is now also associated with a project besides the owner.

  * In resource creation, project defaults to the user-specific system
    project, if not specified otherwise. It is also possible to change the
    project assignment of an existing resource.

  * All existing resources have been assigned to the respective
    user-specific system projects.

* Logging mechanism for Synnefo management commands

  * Log all stdout and stderr output of every invocation of snf-manage,
    on unique filenames under a given directory.

  * Add a new setting in the snf-common package, namely 'LOG_DIR', which
    specifies the directory to be used by Synnefo components to write
    their log files.

* Rename argument names of Synnefo management commands

  * All Synnefo management commands now use 'user/flavor/image/network'
    as argument names, instead of 'userid/user-id/owner/flavor-id/image
    -id/network-id', for consistency across commands.

Astakos
-------

* Decouple projects from applications:

  * Support project creation (by the system) and modification (by a
    privileged user) without the need to submit/approve an application.

  * View applications as modifications. When a project is uninitialized
    (e.g. an application for a new project is pending), no further
    modification is allowed.

  * Applications are removed from the API. A project's last application is
    only accessible as part of the project details.

  * Decouple project state from application state; they can be combined by
    an API client, if needed.

* Changes concerning quota and pool projects:

  * A project must provide limits for all registered resources. On project
    activation, resources missing are automatically completed using a
    skeleton.

  * Field `uplimit' of registed resources is exposed as `system_default' and
    provide the skeleton for user-specific system projects. A new field
    `project_default' is introduce to act as a skeleton for conventional
    projects.

  * The quotaholder now also records project quota besides user quota. The
    two types of holders are distinguished with a prefix: `user:' and
    `project:'.

  * The quota API is extended to make project quota available.

  * Removed setting `ASTAKOS_PROJECTS_VISIBLE'; we now always display
    projects in Astakos menu.

* Projects can be set `private', making it accessible only to its owner and
  members.

* Admin users API

  * Extend astakos identity API to support user management functionality.
  * Admin API related settings
  * ``ADMIN_API_ENABLED``
    Whether or not the admin api endpoints will be enabled.
  * ``ADMIN_API_PERMITTED_GROUPS``
    A list of group names for which users which belong to any of
    them be granted full access to the admin API endpoints.


*  Updated projects integration in UI

  * Display both max per member/total in group quota in project views.
  * Enhanced usage view to display individual resource usage details for
    each of the projects the user is associated with.
  * Display project usage statistics in project details view.
  * Display system projects in admin project list view.
  * Handle display of infinite resource quota values.

* Explicitly specify the lists in which every notification will be sent.


Cyclades
--------

* Introduce Volumes and Snapshots:

  * Implement 'cyclades_volumes' service, containing the /volumes, /types,
    and /snapshots API endpoints under '/volumes/v2.0'.
  * Implement `snf-manage volume-{create, list, show, modify, inspect, remove}'
    management commands for handling of volumes.
  * Implement `snf-manage snapshot-{create, list, show, modify}` management
    commands for handling of snapshots.
  * Implement 'volume-type-{create, list, modify, show, remove}` management
    commands for handling of volume types.
  * Implement reconciliation for stale snapshots.
  * Add new settings:

    * GANETI_MAX_DISKS_PER_INSTANCE: Maximum number of disks that each Ganeti
      instance can have.
    * CYCLADES_VOLUME_MAX_SIZE: The maximum allowed size (in GB) for Cyclades
      volumes.
    * CYCLADES_SNAPSHOTS_ENABLED: Enable/Disable the snapshots feature
      altogether at the API level.


* Integrate Cyclades resources with Astakos projects.

  * Extend API calls that create resources with the 'project' attribute
    in order to assign resources to the specified project.
  * Implement API calls for reassigning resources to a new project.
  * Export the project that a resource belongs in the 'tenant_id' API
    attribute.

* Add support for snf-vncauthproxy 1.6 (configurable VNC console types).
* Change the ``CYCLADES_VNCAUTHPROXY_OPTS`` setting to a list of dictionaries
  and support configurable vncauthproxy proxy addresses (added in
  snf-vncauthproxy-1.6).
* Add support for more types of VM console:

  * Modify the current 'console' action to support VNC WebSockets (requires
    snf-vncauthproxy=1.6).
  * Add support for the three OpenStack Compute console actions
    (VNC, RDP, Spice). RDP and Spice are currently not implemented.

* Update Cyclades to work with Pithos with integrated Archipelago v2
  mapfiles.
* Include functionality for checking the status of the Cyclades update path,
  which includes Ganeti, AMQP, snf-ganeti-eventd and snf-dispatcher. This
  functionality is implemented as part of the snf-dispatcher and can be used
  by passing the '--status-check' option.
* Add setting `CYCLADES_VM_MAX_METADATA` to limit the maximum number of
  metadata per vm.
* Add setting `CYCLADES_VOLUME_MAX_METADATA` to limit the maximum number of
  metadata per volume.
* Use common -u/--user option to specify the UUID or email of the user, for
  all management commands.
* Store basic information about images that have been used to create servers,
  in order to preserve this information even if images are deleted from
  Pithos.
* Make 'snf-ganeti-eventd' tolerate failures when processing Ganeti jobs. The
  daemon will not crash but continue to run in order to process jobs that can
  be processed.
* Update 'backend-list' command to not count the free IPs from networks that
  are drained.
* Fix the'network-inspect' command to not contain externally reserved IPs
  in th number of available IPs.
* Add `GANETI_DISKS_WAIT_FOR_SYNC` setting to decide whether Ganeti will
  wait for the disk mirror to sync (`--no-wait-for-sync` Ganeti option).
* Fix mishandling of `MAX_CIDR_BLOCK` setting. Allowed CIDR sizes
  changed from (MAX_CIDR_BLOCK, 29) to [MAX_CIDR_BLOCK, 29].
* Fix various minor bugs.
* Remove stale '--public' and '--user' options from 'image-show' and
  'snapshot-show' management commands.

.. _Changelog-0.15:

v0.15
=====

Released: Mon Mar 10 14:01:32 EET 2014


Synnefo-wide
------------

* Integrate Pithos tests in continuous integration.

* Change astakosclient to accept AUTH_URL instead of BASE_URL
  ASTAKOS_BASE_URL settings has been removed from Pithos and Cyclades
  and has been replaced with ASTAKOS_AUTH_URL. Both Pithos and Cyclades
  proxy the Astakos services under ASTAKOS_PROXY_PREFIX path.
  ASTAKOS_PROXY_PREFIX by default has a value of '_astakos'.
  More specifically, Astakos' identity service is proxied under
  '_astakos/identity', Astakos' account service is under '_astakos/account'
  and Astakos' ui service is under '_astakos/ui'.

* Add 'mail_admins' handler to 'django.request' logger in order to send email
  notifications to users listed in 'ADMINS' setting about unhandled exceptions
  in the code.

* Extend astakosclient to request and validate OAuth 2.0 access tokens

* Change response status code from 400 (Bad Request) to 405 (Not allowed
  method) in case of an unexpected request method.

Astakos
-------

* Changes in project schema:

  * A Project entry is created when submitting an application for a new
    project, rather than on approval. Its state is dependent on the state
    of its `reference' application (current definition). Lock Project rather
    than Chain (the latter is semantically obsolete).

  * Project states "Active - Pending" and "Suspended - Pending" have been
    removed. In management command `project-list', the existence of a pending
    modification is indicated by a non-blank `Pending AppID'.

  * Improve recording of project, application, and membership actions.

* Implement API calls for projects.
* Store the base URL of a component. Deployer should provide it when adding
  a new component. Service endpoints originating from a component are
  expected to match its base URL; otherwise, a warning is issued.
  Re-registration with `snf-component-register' affects both the base and
  the ui URL.
* Changes in resource and quota handling:

  * New resources are registered with unlimited default base quota,
    represented by 2**63-1.
  * Each newly accepted user copies the default value for all resources
    as their own base quota. A base quota is considered 'custom' if its
    value differs from the default.
  * Changing resource's default quota affects the base quota *only* of
    future users.
  * Resource definition got flags 'api_visible' and 'ui_visible',
    replacing flag 'allow_in_projects'. They control whether a user can
    access these resources. The system internally always accounts for
    all resources, and a user can get off quota even for a resource that
    is not visible.

* Remove API call GET /account/v1.0/authenticate in favor of
  POST /identity/v2.0/tokens.
* Export basic statistics about Astakos service at the '/admin/stats/detail' API
  endpoint. Access to this endpoint is only allowed to users that belong to
  the Astakos groups that are defined in the
  'ASTAKOS_ADMIN_STATS_PERMITTED_GROUPS' setting. Statistics are also available
  through the 'snf-manage stats-astakos' management command.
* Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant
  Add API calls for authorization code and access token generation
* Add API call for validating OAuth 2.0 access tokens
* **Shibboleth module** Extract unique identifier from the
  ``REMOTE_USER`` header.
* Automatically fill third-party signup form fields when available by the
  the third-party provider.
* Management commands:

  * Introduced new commands:

    * component-show
    * quota-list (replacing quota, supports various filters)
    * quota-verify (replacing quota)
    * oauth2-client-add (register OAuth 2.0 client)
    * oauth2-client-list (list registered oauth 2.0 clients)
    * oauth2-client-remove (remove OAuth 2.0 client)

  * Changed commands:

    * component-add got options --base-url and --ui-url
    * resource-modify --limit became --default-quota
    * user-modify can operate on multiple users with --all and --exclude
    * user-modify --set-base-quota became --base-quota

  * Removed commands:

    * quota
    * resource-import (subsumed by service-import)
    * resource-export-astakos (subsumed by service-export-astakos)

* Fix request authorization code failures due to Unicode issue:
  https://code.grnet.gr/issues/4971
* Omit validation issues for non-required metadata values received from the
  third-party authentication provider.

Cyclades
--------

* Major changes to Cyclades networks:

  * Implement 'cyclades_network' service, containing the /networks, /ports,
    /subnets and /floatingips API endpoints under '/network/v2.0'. The old
    /networks API of 'cyclades_compute' (under /compute/v2.0) is
    removed.
  * Implement `snf-manage subnet-{create, list, modify, inspect}' management
    commands for handling of subnets.
  * Implement `snf-manage port-{create, list, remove, inspect}' management
    commands for handling of ports.
  * Add two new settings, 'CYCLADES_FORCED_SERVER_NETWORKS' and
    'CYCLADES_DEFAULT_SERVER_NETWORKS' to control the networks that newly
    created servers will be connected.

* Implement Floating IP addresses, which are IPv4 addresses that can be
  dynamically added and removed to a running server.

  * Add new 'cyclades.floating_ip' resource.
  * Implement 'snf-manage floating-ip-{create,list,remove,attach,detach}'
    management commands to handle floating IPs.
  * Add 'floating_ip_pool' attribute to networks to mark networks that can
    be used as floating IP pools.

* Implement 'resize' server action.

  * Implement the 'resize' server action, to change the flavor of a server.
    Only 'cpu' and 'memory' resizing is supported.

* Compute quotas for CPU and memory of running VMs.

  * Change 'cyclades.cpu' and 'cyclades.ram' resources to represent the CPU
    and RAM for running VMs. Total CPU and RAM usage is represented by new
    'cyclades.total_cpu' and 'cyclades.total_ram' resources.

* Refer to Ganeti NICs by their name instead of their index.

  * Make cyclades give a unique name to each Ganeti NIC. NICs are refered by
    their unique name and not by their index inside the VM that are connected
    to.

* Support firewall profile for all NICs of an instance. Change firewall
  settings to be filled with the unique name of the NIC. The affected settings
  are the GANETI_FIREWALL_{ENABLED, DISABLED, PROTECTED}_TAG settings.
* Add accounting for public IP addresses that is accessible via `snf-manage
  ip-list` management command and via the helpdesk app.
* Implement IPv6 only networks.
* Extend servers info API response with 'SNF:fqdn' attribute, and introduce
  CYCLADES_SERVERS_FQDN to set the template for servers FDQN. Remove
  'UI_VM_HOSTNAME_FORMAT' setting.
* Extend servers info API response with 'SNF:port_forwarding' attribute,
  describing port forwarding rules (DNAT) that are applied to vms. The
  description of such rules is done via the new CYCLADES_PORT_FORWARDING
  setting.
* Speed up server reconciliation, by performing parallel reconciliation for
  each backend.
* Change --dhcp option of network management commands from a flag to a boolean
  value, e.g. --dhcp=True
* Remove 'ARCHIPELAGO_BACKENDS' setting used to distinguish between backends
  that hosted only archipelago backends. Instead allocation is based on which
  disk-templates are enabled in each backend.
* Implement 'snf-manage server-remove' management command.
* Move reconciliation of IP pools from 'reconcile-networks' to
  'reconcile-pools'. The IP pool reconciliation does not reconcile the IP
  pools with Ganeti. Instead it checks if the pool is consistent with the
  IPs that are used by instances.
* Do not automatically release externally reserved IPs if they are released
  from a Ganeti backend. Management of externally reserved IPs must be
  performed from Cyclades with 'network-modify' command.
* Export basic statistics about Cyclades Service at the '/admin/stats/detail'
  API endpoint. Access to this endpoint is only allowed to users that belong
  to the Astakos groups that are defined in the 'ADMIN_STATS_PERMITTED_GROUPS'
  setting.  Statistics are also available through the 'snf-manage stats-cyclades'
  management command.
* Support enforcing quota through command 'enforce-resources-cyclades'.
* Remove command 'resource-export-cyclades' subsumed by
  'service-export-cyclades'.
* Obsolete PUBLIC_USE_POOL setting, since Cyclades manages IP pool for all
  type of networks.
* Encrypt / decrypt the instance id / hostname in the  stats URL in
  snf-cyclades-app and snf-stats-app, using the 'CYCLADES_STATS_SECRET_KEY'
  and 'STATS_SECRET_KEY' respectively.
* Add support for snf-vncauthproxy-1.5 and the setting
  'CYCLADES_VNCAUTHPROXY_OPTS', which configures the extra options / arguments
  needed by the newer version of snf-vncauthproxy. Support for older versions
  of snf-vncauthproxy has been dropped. See also the upgrade notes for Synnefo
  and snf-vncauthproxy-1.5.
* Remove 'DEFAULT_ROUTING_TABLE' setting. If a link for an IP_LESS_ROUTED
  network is not specified, the link will be uniquely named
  'snf-link-$network_id'.
* Extend flavors with 'allow_create' attribute. Flavors that have this
  attribute unset cannot be used by users to create new servers.
* Store each image property(metadata) as a separate Pithos metadata and check
  that the size of each property is valid.
* Fix a few occurrences of HTTP 500 errors being triggered due to insufficient
  validation of incoming requests in the Network API
* Speed up some API calls by fixing the relevant DB queries

------------

* Create 'snf_django' Python package to hold common code for all Synnefo
  components.

* Create a JSON-exportable definition document for each Synnefo Components
  (Astakos, Cyclades, Pithos, etc.) that consolidates APIs (services),
  resources, and other standardized properties (e.g. default URL prefixes).

* Standardize URLs for Synnefo Components, impose structure and naming
  conventions to related settings. Make each component deployable under
  a user-configurable <COMPONENT>_BASE_URL. Each API (compute, image, etc.)
  is deployable under a developer-configurable prefix beneath BASE_URL.

* Deprecate CLOUDBAR_ACTIVE_SERVICE setting from all apps.

* Common synnefo 404/500 templates (located in snf-webproject)

Astakos
-------

* Redesign of the accounting system (quotaholder) and integration into
  Astakos.

  * Simplified the quotaholder model; removed tables Entity and Policy; now
    table Holding contains limit and usage for every holding.
  * Extended table Holding, so that we can keep track of quota for every
    valid combination of holder (e.g. user), resource, and source (e.g. the
    default system or some specific project).
  * Refactored code for issuing and resolving commissions for robustness;
    added a 'force' option to bypass the upper limit check when issuing a
    commission.
  * Simplified syncing to the quotaholder; removed fields from models
    Project and ProjectMembership, previously needed for syncing; removed
    state PROJECT_DEACTIVATED from ProjectMembership.
  * Removed settings ASTAKOS_QUOTAHOLDER_URL, ASTAKOS_QUOTAHOLDER_TOKEN,
    and ASTAKOS_QUOTAHOLDER_POOLSIZE.

* API-related changes:

  * Implemented API calls for quota, resources, and commissions.
  * Moved all API calls under '/account/v1.0'.
  * Implemented the keystone API call POST /tokens under '/identity/v2.0'.

* Service and resource specification and handling:

  * Specified a format for defining services along with the API endpoints
    and the resources they expose. Migrated internal resource name by
    prefixing it with service name (e.g. 'vm' becomes 'cyclades.vm');
    renamed registered service 'pithos+' to 'pithos'.
  * Specified a procedure to register a Synnefo component, its services and
    their resources in astakos and set the resources' default base quota
    limit. Removed resource definitions from settings.
  * Moved service and resource presentation data out of the respective db
    models into a separate file of UI constants.

* Converted the limit on pending applications from a setting to a quotable
  resource. Converted the related user setting to a user-specific base quota
  limit. Deprecated model UserSetting; removed setting
  ASTAKOS_PENDING_APPLICATION_LIMIT.

* Changes in locking strategy:

  * Lock only project's chain for all project operations; lock user before
    syncing to quotaholder.
  * When locking multiple rows (e.g. users or holdings) include an ORDER BY
    clause in the query to impose ordering on locking.

* Changes in views:

  * Replaced custom transaction context with a simple decorator for managing
    transactions and a context 'ExceptionHandler', which logs and suppresses
    exceptions

* Added fine grain user auth provider's policies.

  * Administrator can override default auth provider policies to a specific
    user or group of users.
  * Optionally a user can be assigned to a list of groups, based on the
    authentication method he choosed to signup.

* Removed explicit handling of SMTP errors on each email delivery. Exceptions
  are now propagated to base django exception handler.

* Email used in html/email tempaltes which prompt user to contact for service
  support prompts is now defined in ``CONTACT_EMAIL`` setting introduced in
  snf-common settings.

* Improvements in user activation flow

  * User moderation now takes place after the user has verified his email
    address.
  * User model enriched with additional user state fields
  * Split activation email from moderation process. Administrator is required
    to moderate user explicitly using the `user-modify --accept` or
    `user-modify --reject` commands.
  * Improved logging throught out user activation procedures.

* Remove deprecated AstakosUser model fields: `provider`,
  `third_party_identifier`

* Allow override of authentication provider messages using the following
  format in setting names: ``ASTAKOS_<PROVIDER_MODULE>_<MSGID>_MSG``

* Cloudbar automatically tries to identify the active service based on window
  location.

* Removing authentication provider view is now CSRF protected.

* New `API access` view, containing useful information to users on how to
  access available Synnefo services API's.

* Remove of ASTAKOS_*_EMAIL_SUBJECT settings. All email subjects are now
  defined in astakos.im.messages module. Overriding default values can be
  achieved using custom gettext files or using astakos messages settings::

	#change of greeting email subject
  	ASTAKOS_GREETING_EMAIL_SUBJECT_MESSAGE = 'Welcome to my cloud'

* Remove ``ASTAKOS_ACTIVATION_REDIRECT_URL`` and ``ASTAKOS_LOGIN_SUCCESS_URL``
  from astakos .conf file. Settings are dynamically computed based on
  ``ASTAKOS_BASE_URL``.

* Management commands:

  * Introduced new commands:
     * authpolicy-{add, list, remove, set, show}
     * group-{add, list}
     * component-{add, list, modify, remove}
     * reconcile-resources-astakos

     * user-invite
     * user-set-initial-quota (integrated its functionality in user-modify and quota)
  * Added quota and project-related information in user-show command; added
    membership information in project-show.
